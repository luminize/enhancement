Refactoring documentation
=========================

====
This is the log of me, trying to fit change the way of documenting for the
Machinekit project. With this I'm testing the workflow for enhancing the documentation.
====

I made 3 git repositories on github/luminize

`upstream`

`enhancement`

`subtree`

Locally I made files in a git repo and added /docs/src directory to `upstream`
====
`upstream` means "LunixCNC"

`enhancement` means "Machinekit"

`subtree` means "/docs"
====

If I am correct then the "/docs" should go als in subtree.wiki.git as that will
be easily modified by other people.

Then modifications from Github can be pulled into subtree
