this line will have to show up in textfile3.asciidoc in the `enhancement/subtree-branch' after:
. a pull of `upstream-source/master` in `enhancement/upstream-branch`
. rebase of `enhancement/master' onto `enhancement/upstream-branch`
. merge of `enhancement/subtree-branch` with `enhancement/subtree-branch`

while this current file fas a different extension, namely `.asciidoc`
changes will be able to be merged as it seems.
